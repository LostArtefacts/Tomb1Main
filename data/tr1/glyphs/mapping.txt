# This file is used by the tooling in the tools/glyphs/ directory and is
# crucial for the game's graphical text handling, serving two roles:
#
# 1. Hardcoding Unicode to sprite mapping
#    It generates C macros that map Unicode code points and escaped sequences
#    to O_ALPHABET's sprite indices, specify glyph dimensions, and instruct how
#    to compose compound characters - all getting hardcoded into the executable.
# 2. Guidance for font.bin creation
#    It directs the injector tool in creating the font.bin file that contains
#    O_ALPHABET sprite bitmaps, along with additional positional information.
#
# Important notes:
# - Some sprite indices are fixed. This is for compatibility with the original
#   game to retains original text format even if font.bin goes missing.
# - Glyphs are ordered for efficient lookup by the naive strcmp()-based
#   implementation we have now. Thus the most used glyphs (ASCII and icons)
#   should retain their early position in the file.
