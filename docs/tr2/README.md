TR2X is currently in the early stages of development, focusing on the
decompilation process. We recognize that there is much work to be done.

## Windows

### Installing (manual)

1. Head over to GitHub releases: https://github.com/LostArtefacts/TRX/releases
2. Download the TR2X zip file.
3. Extract the TR2X zip file into a directory of your choice.  
   Make sure you choose to overwrite existing directories and files.
