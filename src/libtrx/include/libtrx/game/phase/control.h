//    phase and wait one frame before repeating the cycle, or
//    PHASE_ACTION_NO_WAIT which will immediately repeat the control routine
//    without drawing or waiting the current cycle. The latter is useful for
//    easier state switches.
//    The gf_cmd member is unused in this scenario.
//
// 2. To end the current phase and carry on continuing current game sequence,
//    .action member should be set to PHASE_ACTION_END, and .gf_cmd.action
//    member should be set to GF_NOOP.
//
// 3. To end the current phase and switch to another game sequence, .action
//    member should be set to PHASE_ACTION_END, and .gf_cmd.action member
//    should be set to the phase to switch to.
